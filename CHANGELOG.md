- Fixed `count()` error when saving a single slot.

### Removed

- [webpatser/laravel-uuid](https://github.com/webpatser/laravel-uuid)

## [v0.6.2](https://gitlab.com/daveroverts/Book-me-a-cookie/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2) - 2018-09-28

### Added

- [beyondcode/laravel-er-diagram-generator](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-er-diagram-generator) as a dev dependency.
- This changelog.
- `Cancel Reservation` in `booking.edit` view
- `StoreEventRequest`, used by `EventController@store()`

### Changed

- Issue if multiple events where active, ordering was not correct in this case.
- Makes `store()` for the following controllers:
  - AirportController
  - AirportLinkController
  - EventController

## [v0.6.1](https://gitlab.com/daveroverts/Book-me-a-cookie/compare/v0.6.0b...v0.6.1) - 2018-09-25

### Added

- Check if user has multiple bookings in navbar
  - 1 booking: Still same behaviour
  - Multiple: Each callsign will now be shown
- Check in navbar if event is active (between `startBooking` and `endEvent`). If active, and user has booking, they will show (see above).

### Changed

- Fixed issue where title on booking.show, and booking.edit always shows 'My **reservation**'.
- Fixed some spelling here and there.
- Temporary hiding FAQ till I wrote something where admins can do stuff with it.
- Temporary allows users to have multiple bookings (but not reservations)
- Replaces [Laravel Excel](https://github.com/Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel) for [rap2hpoutre/fast-excel](https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/fast-excel).
  - [rap2hpoutre/fast-excel](https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/fast-excel) was already used in `v0.6.0`, but only for imports.
  - [rap2hpoutre/fast-excel](https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/fast-excel) is now also used for exports, and thus everything related to Laravel Excel has been removed.

### Removed

- `sendFeedbackFrom` from views, controllers, and DB. It was never really used.
  - Alternative (that was already known) would be to send everybody an E-mail with the button shown in `event.overview`

## [v0.6.0](https://gitlab.com/daveroverts/Book-me-a-cookie/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0b) - 2018-09-23

  - Added 3 stages, `build`, `test`, and `deploy`
  - `build`: Adds `composer` for PHP, and `yarn` for JS/CSS
  - Added `phpcs` in test stage
  - Added deployment to my stage enviroment.
- Support for different event types.
- Import script for airports.
- Import script for bookings.
